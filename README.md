# Snake-X-Slither.io-Clone
It is an online game where I took the mechanics of both snake and slither.io where you only have 1 food and you have to race for it but the goal of the game is to eliminate the other player. You may get the food for the advantage but you need to be careful not to get eliminated by other players.

# Running on Local Network
Before you run this game you need to do some small changes to the network and server file. You need to change the server variable to match the local IP address of your network.

# Running the game
The server needs to be running before you run the client programs.

# Game Mechanics
1. The goal of the game is to be the last man standing.
2. Food is place accross the game randomly just like in snake.
3. But like slither.io you can pass through your own body but the enemy's.
4. You can get the food to increase your length for your advantage but beware of the enemy that may also try to get the food.

# Possible Issues
1. If you can't connect to the server, turn off your firewall on the client and server machines.
